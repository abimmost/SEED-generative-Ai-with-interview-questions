EXERCISE 1(COMPLETED):

Challenges:

- Trying to use model: While trying to use the distilgpt2 HF model, at first, I put the model name where the task(e.g. sentiment-analysis) was supposed to go. I received a runtime error from pipeline showing a list of tasks that can be used and model names were not among. 
What I did next was I hovered over the pipeline function and got a brief overview of the documentation where I saw how to use the model, which is thanks to PyLance, and also other parameters that pipeline() can take.
- text-generation vs text2text-generation: These are the two tasks I decided to use for this exercise but one of them proved to be useless. I realized when I used text-generation that it just spit out the same text I gave it but text2text-generation returned a response with given text.
I used the text2text-generation to get proper answers or responses for the text
- Changing uvicorn port: Using "--port 0" option hosts on a port not in use. Specifying the port to be used is also an option.
